This repository contains a simulation infrastructure for LoRaWAN end nodes. As the initial purpose of this solution was to stress test a LoRaWAN network server, and not necessarily implement a full-blown simulator, only uplink traffic is generated at this point, and devices are expected to be provisioned via ABP.
